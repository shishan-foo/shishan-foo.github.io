### Target
To make sure that I can have access the VM safely regardless my physical location, I want to mask all my internet devices with a dedicated IP address and then add that IP address to the whitelist of VM's firewall to restrict the access to my VM.

### Study
#### Proxies
There are two types of proxies

1. **Forward Proxies**: it hides the identity of the clients. Forward Proxies store and forward Internet services to reduce and control the bandwidth used by the group.
2. **Reverse Proxies**: it acts in behalf of servers and hide the identity of the servers.

I read form:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling

Obviously, the forward proxy is what I'm looking for. Next I need to search for the right product which can provide this service.
